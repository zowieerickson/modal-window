# modal-window
Practiced opening and closing modals 'classList.add/remove' in JavaScript. 
I also practiced for the first time using a key press to close out a window. 
Here, I used the Escape key to close out the modals, in addition to being able to click outside the modal and clicking the 'X' key to close the modal.
